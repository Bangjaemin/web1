Examples are better than 1000 words. Examples are often easier to understand than text explanations.
 This tutorial supplements all explanations with clarifying "Try it Yourself" examples.
 vaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
1. HTML to define the content of web pages
2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
 Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
