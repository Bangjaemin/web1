W3C is accepting proposals from outside vendors to redesign the existing W3C website. Our organization, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, produces open and royalty-free Web Standards and guidelines that make the Web work, for everyone.
We believe that by implementing current web best practices and technologies, revising the information architecture, creating a content strategy and revamping the visual design, we can provide our audiences with the best information in a more user-friendly fashion, motivate participation in the organization, and communicate the nature and impact of the W3C more effectively.
The current website was redesigned in 2008, moving to a responsive layout, a revised architecture and a custom CMS. Now over 10 years old, the website is showing its age and we have determined that it is not as effective in supporting the W3Câ€™s mission and goals as it could be.
The purpose of our Website redesign RFP is to identify a fully qualified proposer. Interested parties are encouraged to take advantage of the open Questions and Answers period, and required to submit a written proposal to Coralie Mercier, Head of W3C Marketing & Communications who manages this project, no later than 13 December 2019 1700 UTC. We expect to award the project on January 10, 2020.
